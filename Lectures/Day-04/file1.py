# In Python, the __init__ method is a special method also known as a constructor. It is used to initialize the attributes of an object when an instance of a class is created. The __init__ method is called automatically when you create a new object from a class.

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
