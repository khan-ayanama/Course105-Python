# Object
# It is class type variable or class instance. To use a class, we should create an object to the class.
# Each object of a class has it's own copy of data memebers defined the class.

# BTS:

# A block of memory is allocated on heap. The size of allocated memory is to be decided from the attributes and methods availble in the class.

# After allocating memory block, the special method __init__() is called internally. This method stores the initial data into variables.

# The allocated memory location address of the instance is returned into the object

# The memory location is passed to self.
