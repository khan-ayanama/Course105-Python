# Abstract Class
# A class derived from ABC class which belongs to abc module, is known as abstract class in python
# Parent class is also known as Meta class
# Abstract class can have abstract method and concrete method
# PVM can not create objects of an abstract class

# A abstract method is a method whose action is redefined in the child class 
# Example:
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
# class Father(ABC):
#     @abstractmethod
#   def disp(self):
#       pass


# Concrete method
# method which defined in abstract class

# IF there is any abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
