# Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to perform arithmetic operations while assigning value to a variable

result = 5 / 2
print(result)  # Output: 2.5

result = 5 // 2
print(result)  # Output: 2

# Assignment operator =
x = 5

# Addition assignment operator +=
x += 3  # Equivalent to x = x + 3

# Subtraction assignment operator -=
y = 8
y -= 2  # Equivalent to y = y - 2

# Multiplication assignment operator *=
z = 4
z *= 2  # Equivalent to z = z * 2

# Division assignment operator /=
w = 10
w /= 5  # Equivalent to w = w / 5

# Modulus assignment operator %=
a = 15
a %= 4  # Equivalent to a = a % 4

# Floor division assignment operator //=
b = 20
b //= 3  # Equivalent to b = b // 3

# Exponentiation assignment operator **=
c = 2
c **= 3  # Equivalent to c = c ** 3

# Displaying results
print("x:", x)
print("y:", y)
print("z:", z)
print("w:", w)
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
print("c:", c)
