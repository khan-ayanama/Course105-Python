# SUMMARY

# Immutable: Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. Operations on strings create new strings.

# Unicode Support: Python strings are Unicode by default, allowing the representation of characters from various languages and writing systems.

# String Slicing: Easily extract substrings using slicing (my_string[start:end]). This makes it convenient to work with portions of a string.

# Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator or the join() method for improved performance, especially with large lists of strings.

# String Formatting:
# C-style formatting: "Hello, %s!" % name
# str.format(): "Hello, {}!".format(name)
# F-strings: "Hello, {name}!"
# Triple Quotes: Triple quotes (''' or """) allow the creation of multiline strings, useful for docstrings, SQL queries, or multiline text.

# String Methods: Python provides a variety of string methods for operations such as case manipulation, finding substrings, splitting, joining, and more.

# Raw Strings: Raw strings (r"raw_string") treat backslashes as literal characters, useful for regular expressions or file paths.

# String Representation (repr()): The repr() function provides a detailed and unambiguous representation of strings.

# String Interpolation: Easily insert variable values into string literals using f-strings or the % operator for formatted strings.

# Escape Characters: Python supports escape characters (\n, \t, etc.) for representing special characters within strings.

# String Comparison: String comparison is lexicographic, and Python provides methods like startswith(), endswith(), isdigit(), isalpha(), and isalnum().

# Whitespace Handling: Methods like strip(), lstrip(), and rstrip() are used for whitespace handling at the beginning, end, or both ends of a string.

# Memory Efficiency: String interning and memory optimization techniques make Python efficient in handling strings.

# Built-in Functions: Python includes built-in functions like len(), ord(), chr(), and str() for various string-related operations
