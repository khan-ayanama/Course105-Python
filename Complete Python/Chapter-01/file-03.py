# Python Virtual Machine

# Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is a program which provides programming environment. The rle of PVM to convert the byte code instruction and display the output.
# Interepreter converts the byte code into machine code and sends that machine code to th e computer processor for execution.

# Identifier
# An identifier is a name having few letter, numbers and special characters_
# It should alwas start with a non-numeric character.
# It should used to identify a variable, function, symbolic constand, class etc.
# Python is case sensitive

# CONSTANTS
# In Python, a constant is typically represented by a variable whose value should not be modified during the execution of a program. However, it's important to note that Python doesn't have a built-in constant type like some other programming languages.

# Conventionally, constants in Python are usually written in uppercase letters to distinguish them from variables, and they are not meant to be changed once they are set. While the language itself doesn't enforce constant behavior, it's more of a convention that programmers follow.

# Define a constant
MY_CONSTANT = 42

# Attempt to change the constant (though it's not prevented by Python)
# Avoid doing this to adhere to the constant convention
# MY_CONSTANT = 21  # Uncommenting this line would result in an error of style

# Using the constant
print("The value of the constant is:", MY_CONSTANT)
