# How Python Works

# Byte Code: Byte Code represents the fixed set of instruction created by Python deveopers representing all types of operations like arithmetic operations, comparison, memory related opeations etc.
# The size of each byte code instruction is 1 byte
# we can find byte code instuction in .pyc file

# Python Compiler
# A python Compiler converts the program source code into byte code.
# Types of Pyton Compilers
# Cpython, Jpython, AnacondaPython etc

# Steps of Python Programs
# 1. Write Source Code
# 2. Compile the progarm using Python Compiler
# 3. Compiler converts the python program into byte code.
# 4. Machine can't understand Byte code so we convert it into machine code using PVM
# 5. PVM uses an interpreter which understands the byte code and convert it into machine code
# 6. Machine code instructions are then executed by processor and results are displayed
