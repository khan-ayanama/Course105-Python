# Lecture-01 (Origin, functionality and scope of Python)

## Software

* Software is a collection of programs
* Programs are the set of instructions.

### Software types:-

* System Software --> OS, Compiler, Driver, Coder, Linker.
* Application --> Desktop Windows
* Web Application
* Device Application
* AI/IOT

## Problems before python

* Complex Syntax

* `Verbose Code:` Some languages required writing a large amount of code to accomplish simple tasks. This verbosity made development time-consuming and increased the chances of introducing errors.

* `Lack of Readability`

* `Limited Standard Libraries:` Some languages lacked comprehensive standard libraries, requiring developers to write custom code for common tasks. This increased development time and effort.

* `Platform Dependency`

* `Steep Learning Curve`

* `Poor Support for Diverse Programming Paradigms:` Some languages were tailored for specific programming paradigms, such as procedural or object-oriented programming, limiting developers' flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for their projects.

## Why python Developed
Python was developed with the primary goal of creating a programming language that is easy to read, write, and understand. `Guido van Rossum`, the creator of Python, started working on the language in the late 1980s, and the first official Python release occurred in 1991. Several key principles and objectives guided the development of Python:

* `Readability and Simplicity`

* `Ease of Learning`

* `Versatility:` Python was created as a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This versatility allows developers to choose the most suitable approach for their specific tasks.

* `Portability:` Python is platform-independent, meaning that Python code can run on any platform without modification. This portability is valuable in diverse computing environments.

* `Large Standard Library`

## What is python?

Python is:

* Open Source --> Anyone can see the source code
* free ware --> No need to purchase
* Procedure + function + OOP's
* Platform independent

## Procedural language

## .py vs .pyc

PY files contain Python source code file for a program, while . pyc files contain interpreted bytecode of python application.

## Platform dependent language

If any language creates .exe file they are platform dependent language, while compilation C/C++ code it needs .dll(document linking library file) file which will be provided by OS.

## Platform Independent Language

Software which is on server and which can run on any platform which is provide by an application like python and java  

Python is a Interpreter language it uses JIT (Just in Time) compiler which translate python source code to bytecode(.pyc)

Every OS has Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which only requires bytecode to run the program.  

PVM is a part of Python runtime environment.  

Python does not create .exe fiile
